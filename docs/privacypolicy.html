<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This page is used to inform visitors regarding
my policies with the collection, use, and
disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use
my Service.
</p> <p>
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree
to the collection and use of information in relation to this
policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
used for providing and improving the Service.
I will not use or share your
information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
Policy.
</p> <p>
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at
our apps unless otherwise defined in this Privacy
Policy.
</p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>
Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you use our Apps or play our Games, interact with third-party ads in our Apps or with our ads in our Games. In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you use Apps or play our Games and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily contact us. We may also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information).
</p>
<p>
The information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:
</p>
(1) Information that you provide voluntarily
<p>
Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we will ask for certain information in order for you to submit enquiries to us, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>your name, email address or other details, necessary to process your inquiries;</li>
<li>any information you submit to our support team via email.</li>
</ul>
The personal information that you are asked to provide and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, we will try to explain to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.
</p>
(2) Information that we collect automatically
<p>
When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game references or just game preferences, the means by which you were referred to our Services)</li>
<li>Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers (for more see here “Advertising IDs and Device IDs”)</li>
<li>Your device type and the operating system that you use</li> 
<li>Your Service communications (e.g. in-game scores or emotion signals which you exchange with other players)</li>
<li>Broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) based on your IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>
Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for personalized advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out of it by choosing “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out of these ads by choosing “Opt-out of personalized ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.
</p>
<p>
Device identifier / information means device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.
</p>
<p>
Some of this information may be collected through cookies as explained further under the heading Cookies below.
</p>
<p>In addition, our apps may use Camera API or True Depth API to achieve face recognition. But we do not store and share any information with any third-party.</p>
(3)  Information we obtain from third-party sources
<p>
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

</p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and
are stored on your device's internal memory.
</p> <p>
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your
device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be
able to use some portions of this Service.
</p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
I may employ third-party companies
and individuals due to the following reasons:
</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
I want to inform users of this
Service that these third parties have access to your
Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
not to disclose or use the information for any other
purpose.
</p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
I value your trust in providing us
your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click
on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
Note that these external sites are not operated by
me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
I have no control over and assume no
responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
practices of any third-party sites or services.
</p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
I do not knowingly collect personally
identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
I discover that a child under 13 has provided
me with personal information,
I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
has provided us with personal information, please contact
me so that I will be able to do
necessary actions.
</p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
I may update our Privacy Policy from
time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
periodically for any changes. I will
notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
on this page. These changes are effective immediately after
they are posted on this page.

my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact
me.
